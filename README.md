🚀 Zomato Restaurants Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project
This project showcases an end-to-end Business Intelligence dashboard built using Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize restaurant data from Zomato’s public dataset. Covering 9551+ restaurants across 15 countries and 141 cities, the goal was to derive actionable insights about restaurant distribution, cuisine preferences, online services, and customer ratings.

📊 Dashboard Overview:
The interactive Power BI dashboard allows users to explore:

🌍 Global restaurant distribution using dynamic map visualizations

🍝 Cuisine-wise breakdown with counts and average rating comparisons

📦 Online delivery and 🍽️ table booking availability using intuitive donut charts

⭐ Cost vs. rating vs. votes analysis to understand customer behavior

🔄 Interactive slicers and filters to enable multi-dimensional exploration

🔍 Key Insights:
North Indian cuisine emerged as the most popular across regions

74% of restaurants offer online delivery services

Only 12% of restaurants support table reservations

High ratings don’t necessarily correlate with higher cost for two or more votes

These insights can help Zomato or similar platforms identify service gaps, regional cuisine demand, and user preferences to inform business decisions and marketing strategies.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI: Data modeling, interactive visualizations

DAX: Measures and KPIs

Power Query: Data transformation and cleansing

Microsoft Excel: Initial data exploration and formatting

💡 Learnings & Outcomes:
This project significantly improved my skills in data cleaning, storytelling, and building interactive dashboards. It demonstrates my ability to turn raw datasets into visually appealing and insight-driven reports that support strategic decision-making.
